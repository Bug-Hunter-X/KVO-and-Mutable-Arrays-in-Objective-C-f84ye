This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and mutable arrays.  Direct modification of an array without properly notifying observers through KVO's `willChangeValueForKey:` and `didChangeValueForKey:` methods can lead to inconsistent behavior and data corruption. The `bug.m` file showcases this error, and the `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected implementation that uses KVO notifications to ensure data consistency.
