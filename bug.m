In Objective-C, a subtle bug can occur when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) with mutable arrays. If you modify the array directly (e.g., using `addObject:` or `removeObjectAtIndex:`) without using the appropriate KVO methods (`willChangeValueForKey:` and `didChangeValueForKey:`), the observed objects might not receive the necessary updates, leading to inconsistencies or crashes. This often goes unnoticed because the app might seem to function correctly under certain conditions, but it can lead to unpredictable behavior.
